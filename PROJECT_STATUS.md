# Project Status

## Current Phase: 34 — Real-World Test Mode

**Status: implemented.**

Real-World Test Mode lets an admin/sales account run a controlled test
against a real lead/candidate, a real website, and — only when the system
is explicitly configured for it — real LLM output. It is a thin,
auditable wrapper around the existing Sales Workflow; it does not
duplicate Lead Research, Company Intelligence, Personalization, or Email
Draft logic.

**Phase 34 does not enable sending.** There is no send endpoint, no send
button, and no automatic external draft creation anywhere in this phase.
"Completed" only ever means the underlying Sales Workflow finished and
produced CRM records and (usually) an email draft awaiting Human Review
— exactly like running the Sales Workflow directly. Do-not-contact is
checked before every run, regardless of mode, and can never be bypassed.
Approval/completion never means anything was sent.

What was added:

- **Domain**: `RealWorldTestRun` entity + `RealWorldTestRunRepository`
  port (`backend/domain/entities/real_world_test_run.py`,
  `backend/domain/repositories/real_world_test_run_repository.py`).
- **Persistence**: `RealWorldTestRunModel` (table
  `real_world_test_runs`) + `SQLAlchemyRealWorldTestRunRepository`.
- **Service**: `RealWorldTestRunService`
  (`backend/application/real_world_test/real_world_test_run_service.py`)
  — reuses the existing `SalesWorkflowService`, `DoNotContactService`,
  `OfferService`, and `QualityScoreRepository` rather than duplicating
  any of their logic. `mode` (`safe`/`mock`/`real_llm`) only ever governs
  how much of a run may touch real external systems (website fetch, LLM
  provider) — `real_llm` is refused outright (never silently downgraded)
  unless `LLM_ENABLE_REAL_CALLS=true` is already set.
- **API**: `POST/GET /api/v1/real-world-test-runs`,
  `GET /api/v1/real-world-test-runs/{id}`,
  `POST /api/v1/real-world-test-runs/{id}/abort`. RBAC: admin/sales can
  start a run, admin/sales/reviewer can view, admin-only can abort.
- **Frontend**: `/real-world-test` page — start a run against an existing
  Lead Candidate, CRM Lead, or a direct company name; pick an optional
  ICP/Offer profile; pick a mode (default `safe`); view past runs with
  status, warnings, errors, linked Quality Score, and the raw
  input/result snapshot. No send UI anywhere on this page.
- **Tests**: `tests/test_real_world_test_run_service.py` (12 tests),
  `tests/test_api_real_world_test_endpoint.py` (10 tests) — cover safety
  gates (do-not-contact block, `real_llm` mode gate), RBAC, abort state
  machine, and the standing "no send-capable endpoint" regression check.

## Standing Guarantees (apply to every phase, including 34)

- Mock provider is the default everywhere; real providers require
  explicit, separate configuration.
- No automatic email sending, no batch send, no reply-send endpoint, no
  automatic external draft creation.
- Do-not-contact and Human Review are never bypassed by any feature.
- "Approved" / "completed" never means something was sent.
- No secrets, API keys, or tokens are ever logged, committed, or shown in
  the frontend.
